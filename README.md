## About Me
### Hi there. My name is _""Jeeyoung Julie Shin""_. 
 I took a FEWD class last year from Emily . I want to work as a _"web developer"_ and also  "web designer", but frankly, I'm not confident about JavaScript and React field a lot. I want to learn more throughout this class. I love to learn, but sometimes I'm afraid the AI better than the people specially in computer field.  I inspired  _Mark Twain_ 's quote "Worrying about things that might not happen is like paying a debt you don't owe." . So, I try to  new things everyday without any worring.
